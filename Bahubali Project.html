	<p align="center">Amarendra Baahubali, Maharaja Vikramadeva's son, was born in Mahishmati (Magizhmadhi in Tamil). His mother (then Queen) died while giving birth to him. He was named "Baahubali" by his aunt, Rajamatha Sivagami, who later became his foster mother. She recognised his leadership qualities and announced him as the next king after he succeeded in a contest to defend the empire from Kalakaya invasion. Though Bhallala Deva (Palvalthevan in Tamil) killed the Kalakeya king Inkoshi, Baahubali was announced the next king as he showed more honor in the battle. He is envied by Bhallaladeva who manipulates Sivagami who in turn issues an order to Kattappa to execute Baahubali for treason. He is loyal and bound by his promise even at the cost of his throne. He is the father of Mahendra Baahubali alias Sivudu. He was stabbed in the back by Kattappa. He was married to Devasena.He is a skilled warrior with both his sword and the arrows. He can shoot more than one arrow in a single string. He has good battle strategy skills, which proved useful in the battle against Kalakeya tribe.</p>
